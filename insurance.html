                        <em>
                            We do not want you to have any difficulties with your expectations of coverage. 
                            Please read and understand these conditions for being seen by our doctors.

                        <li>
                            Insurance coverage is for a particular <strong>doctor</strong> and not for the office.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Please understand that each insurance company listed under each <a href="about.html">doctor</a> 
                            has hundreds of different plans and the doctors are not providers for all them. Even if you already have a plan 
                            with one of these companies, your visit may still not be covered if your doctor is not a provider in your <em>plan</em>.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Please call your insurance company and verify that you have coverage. Please find out your deductibles. Often these are very large.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            In most cases, we can bill only for PPO plans. If your card has HMO on it, you most likely will not be covered. Please call your insurance to verify.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            If you are seen by the doctors and your insurance deems the charges not eligible, you will be responsible for them. 
                            This is true even if the preliminary check with the insurance company by us indicates that you are covered and you are seen with the expectation that we will bill your insurance. 
                            Until the claim is completed by the insurance, we can not positively know if you are covered.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Some services such as phone consultations with other providers, review of records, rush prescription refills, no-show charges, cancellation fees, form filling, reports, etc. are often 
                            <strong>not</strong> 
                            a reimbursable expense. If these services are used or requested by you, you are responsible for their charge. Your insurance company will not pay for most of these.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            All phone/skype consultations are self-pay. Most insurance companies do not cover any phone consultations.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            A credit card on file is required for automatic billing of unmet deductibles, no-show fees, charges for records etc..Overdue amount will be charged to your credit card on account if not paid after the first statement.
